# UFOs
Dynamic content through javaScript and HTML

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to practice javaScript by creating an HTML with images, 
commentary, and data. I am using javaScript to present a large data set in an organized 
table and create filters so that users of a website can easily locate rows of data based 
on criteria.

## Analysis

### Results
When someone enters the website, there is content and a table. To the right of the table, 
there are five filters: Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. A used can input one, 
several, or all the filters. If an input does not match what is in the table, nothing is 
returned. If inputs match the table, rows are displayed based on that criterion.

## Summary

### Design Limitations
This design is dynamic in that there are filters but this design is limited. The data set 
is static. If something is updated, the update must be manually done through the file 
labeled data.js.

### Recommendation #1
One further development could be to connect the table to an API that updates our website 
when new information is added. If a UFO API is unavailable, perhaps a script could be made 
that scrapes the web for new pictures and updates our table.

### Recommendation #2
Also, a simple suggestion would be to add animation, multiple images (perhaps space crafts), 
more coloring, and different fonts. Currently, the page has two primary colors (white and 
black) and only one image. Adding more style would give the site some pop.
