## Results

- Two conclusions I can draw from my analysis of outcomes based on launch dates:
1)	A launch date of May offers the highest success rate (73.5%)
2)	A launch date of December has the lowest success rate (51.4%)

- Three conclusions I can draw from my analysis of outcomes based on goals:
1)	Goals less than $1,000 have the highest success rate (71%)
2)	Goals greater than $50,000 have the lowest success rate (19%)
However, campaigns that used $1,000 as a goal on average produced less money than campaigns of goals greater than $50,000.
3)	I would reccomend chosing a goal between 1000-4999 because the success rate is only a little lower than $1,000 campaigns
but the potential gain is 5x more.

- This data set does not provide the cost of launching a campaign. If campaigns have no cost, every campaign should have a goal 
of $50,000 or more because 19% of successful over $50,000 campaigns produce more money than 71% of $1,000 campaigns.
If we new what our cost constraints are, we could maximize success rate, goal amount, and month to come up with the optimal
launch date and goal request.

This data set also doesn't show if more than a goal amount was collected on a given campaign.

- We could look at:
1)	The average goal and money collected per successful outcome. As mentioned above, $1000 goals might be the 
most successful but not produce the most money.
2)	The average cost of a campaign associated with a goal range.
